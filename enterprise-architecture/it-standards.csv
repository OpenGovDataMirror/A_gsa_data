The response always includes an answer about whether the request should be allowed using one of four values: Permit, Deny, Indeterminate (an error occurred or some required value was missing, so a decision cannot be made) or Not Applicable (the request can't be answered by this service).","Scripting Language",Denied,Desktop,2018-01-01

The single most important requirement that SAML addresses is web browser single sign-on (SSO). Single sign-on is common at the intranet level (using cookies, for example) but extending it beyond the intranet has been problematic and has led to the proliferation of non-interoperable proprietary technologies. Another more recent approach to addressing the browser SSO problem is the OpenID protocol.","Scripting Language",Denied,Desktop,2018-01-01
